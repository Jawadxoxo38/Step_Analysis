# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report: Apple Health Data

## 1. Introduction

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report aims to analyze and derive insights from Apple Health data. The data has been extracted from Apple Health app and saved in a CSV file for further exploration. The dataset provides information about various health metrics, activities, and trends recorded by the user.

## 2. Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Name:** Apple_Health_Data.csv
- **Size:** [Insert size]
- **Columns:** [Insert list of columns]

### Sample of the Dataset:

| Date       | Steps | Distance (km) | Calories Burned | Heart Rate | Sleep Duration (hours) | ... |
|------------|-------|----------------|------------------|------------|------------------------|-----|
| 2023-01-01 | 8000  | 6.5            | 3000            | 75         | 7.5                    | ... |
| 2023-01-02 | 10000 | 8.0            | 3500            | 82         | 6.8                    | ... |

## 3. Data Cleaning

Before diving into the analysis, a preliminary data cleaning process was performed:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Checked and filled or dropped missing values where appropriate.
- **Data Types:** Ensured that data types of each column are appropriate for analysis.
- **Duplicates:** Removed any duplicate entries.
- **Outliers:** Investigated and addressed any outliers in the data.
